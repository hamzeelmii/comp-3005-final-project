# COMP 3005 - Health and Fitness Club Management System Final Project

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a database for a Health
and Fitness Club Management System. My aim was to build a system that not only
facilitates the typical workflows of a fitness club but also lays the
groundwork for future scalability and expansion. Each file in this repository
is a piece of that larger puzzle, and I've made sure that they all
come together to form a cohesive and robust system.

I've documented the functional requirements in `requirements.md`, which served
as my compass during the development process. You'll also find visual
representations of the database and entity relationships, which
were vital for me to visualize the interconnections within the system. Plus,
there's a collection of test queries in SQL that I used to ensure the database
functions as intended.

### Files Overview

The project consists of various documentation and scripts that define and
interact with the database:

### `requirements.md`

Outlines the functional requirements that shaped the design and implementation
of the database system.

### `Database_Schema.png`

Visual representation of the database schema, detailing how data is structured
within the system.

### `health_and_fitness_club_mgmt_system.md`

Describes the database schema design and the considerations involved in its
construction.

### `normalization_analysis.md`

Provides an analysis of the database tables, ensuring they meet the standards
for the Second and Third Normal Forms (2NF and 3NF).

### `ER_Diagram.png`

The Entity-Relationship diagram image, illustrating the relationships between
the different entities in the system.

### `ER_Assumptions.md`

Discusses the assumptions made during the creation of the ER diagram and explains the relationships between entities.

### `test_queries.sql`

Contains a series of SQL queries designed to test the database's functionality, including adding new records, updating existing data, and retrieving information.
