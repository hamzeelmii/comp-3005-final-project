# Health and Fitness Club Management System - Database Requirements

## Purpose

This document outlines the key requirements I considered while planning the database for the "Health and Fitness Club Management System." My aim was to build a database that not only meets the functional needs of a fitness club but also adheres to best practices in database design, such as normalization and scalability.

## Requirements Overview

The requirements listed here shaped the development of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model and influenced how I structured the database schema. Here's what I focused on:

1. **Member Management:**

   - It was crucial to have a system to store personal details of club members, like their names and email addresses.
   - I wanted a way to keep track of each member's health metrics and fitness goals, which are key to personalized fitness plans.

2. **Class Enrollment and Scheduling:**

   - The system allows members to enroll in various fitness classes, addressing diverse fitness interests.
   - Keeping track of class schedules is vital for smooth club operations.

3. **Personal Training Management:**

   - Members can conveniently schedule, reschedule, or cancel their personal training sessions.
   - Each session's details, including date, time, and the associated member and trainer, are recorded.

4. **Trainer Profiles and Schedules:**

   - Each trainer has a profile showcasing their specializations, which helps members choose the right trainer for their needs.
   - Trainers can manage their schedules and access member profiles for better training plans.

5. **Administrative Tasks:**

   - The admin staff plays a crucial role in managing club resources, including room bookings and equipment maintenance.
   - They also handle billing and payment processing.

6. **Equipment Tracking:**

   - It's important to track different types of equipment in the club and their maintenance schedules to ensure safety and reliability.

7. **Loyalty Program:**

   - To encourage member engagement, the system includes a loyalty program where members earn points for transactions.
   - Members can track and redeem these points.

8. **Authentication and Security:**

- **For the sake of simplicity, there is a unified user authentication system.** This system secures member login access to their dashboard and protects sensitive information.
  - Ensure that user authentication details are stored securely.

9. **Billing and Payments:**

   - The system handles the recording and processing of payments, including membership fees and personal training sessions.
   - Payment history and methods are tracked meticulously.

10. **Reporting and Analytics:**

    - I added features to generate reports on member activities, financials, and equipment usage.
    - The system also supports data analysis for gaining business insights.

11. **Data Integrity and Normalization:**

    - Ensuring that the database is normalized (up to at least 3NF) was essential to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.
    - Clear relationships and dependencies between entities are established for data coherence.

12. **Scalability and Flexibility:**
    - The design is scalable to handle an increase in data volume and adaptable to accommodate future expansions, like new features or system integrations.

I adhered to these requirements when creating the ER model and translating
it into a relational database schema. I focused on making the system not just
functional but also efficient, reliable, and capable of handling the complex
needs of a health and fitness club management system.
